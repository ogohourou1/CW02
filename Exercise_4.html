		<p class="verse">Grips on your waist, front way, back way<br>
		You know that I don't play<br>
		Streets not safe but I never run away<br>
		Even when I'm away<br>
		Oti, oti<br>
		There's never much love when we go OT<br>
		I pray to make it back in one piece<br>
		I pray, I pray</p>
		
		<p class="chorus"> That's why I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me<br>
		I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me</p>
		
		<p class="verse">Strength and guidance<br>
		All that I'm wishing for my friends<br>
		Nobody makes it from my ends<br>
		I had to bust up the silence<br>
		You know you gotta stick by me<br>
		Soon as you see the text, reply me<br>
		I don't wanna spend time fighting<br>
		We've got no time, and that's why<p>
		
		<p class="chorus"> That's why I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me<br>
		I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me</p>
		
		<p class="chorus"> I need a one dance (Where, where, where)<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand (Where, where, where, where)<br>
		One more time 'fore I go (Where)<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me (Where, where, where, where)<br>
		I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me</p>
